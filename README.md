# JavaProject

The project is an imitation of a memory game where there are 9 tiles displayed one after the other every turn, in each new turn the program adds one new tile to click.
The player's task is to remember the displayed order and click on the tiles in order to get the highest score.

Each next round symbolizes the number of points scored.
The program enters the number of points claimed into the local database.
